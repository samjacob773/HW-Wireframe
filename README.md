There are three versions of files in this folder. I included all three for the sake of transparency.

Samindex.html and samstyle.css are both the files I started with, working from past class exercises. As you can see, I was not
really solving the problem correctly. I mixed up my header and heading tags for example. I nested various elements incorrectly. My attempt at using IDs and classes weren't working.

index.html and style.css are the files that The professor slacked out during activities in class. When looking at how the requirements were implemented, the approach was much more streamlined. The style sheet in particular was much simpler, because of the way the author utilized the nesting structure to make it much more elegant and precise.

I wanted to fix my samindex.html and samstyle.css, but I didn't know if I could use any of the approaches used in the sample website that was shared by the professor. I understand if we turn in code as our homework, we are expected to be able to whiteboard the code we used. While I feel comfortable with my understanding of how most of the parts of index.html and style.css work, I would definately not be able to whiteboard it, mainly because my understanding of the top linked css style sheet is lacking. I looked at that massive style sheet. I would not be able to whiteboard that!

So, I tried to alter my older code with the approaches that seemed to work from the slack example code. These are the documents samindex2.html and samstyle2.css. I tried not to just cut and paste. I printed out the sample text, laid it out and tried to understand how it functioned. I also messed around with the values for various attributes, to try and see how things worked. It definately helped me improve my understandings of some of the elements of CSS, but I am still not close to being able to write CSS on the fly without references.

I know we aren't supposed to be turning in three versions of a homework assignment, but I figured since I am perhaps being a bit too literal or simplistic in my understanding of the program's apparoach to plagiarism and academic honesty or I may be correct, it is better to be more transparent about the process. I included all three, as an attempt to clearly show you what I did.
